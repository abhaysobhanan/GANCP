# Genetic Algorithms with Neural Cost Predictor

Genetic Algorithms with Neural Cost Predictor (GANCP) solve Hierarchical Vehicle Routing Problems (HVRPs) by employing a genetic algorithm to make good-quality higher-level decisions, with the aid of a graph neural network that predicts the cost of VRP subproblems.
GANCP, combined with the [HGS-CVRP solver](https://github.com/vidalt/HGS-CVRP) in the final stage, provides the actual routing solutions to the HVRPs, and is referred to as GANCP<sup>+</sup>. 

This repository contains the code for solving large-scale Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problems in `Julia 1.7` using `PyCall` package to perform CVRP cost predictions using GNN implemented in `Python 3.9`. 
If you use GANCP, please cite:

The MDVRP instances should follow the format of Cordeau MDVRP benchmark instances. Example usage of GANCP solver:

1. Load the functions and the MDVRP instance:
```julia
include("src/read_mdvrp.jl")
include("src/main.jl")
instance = read_mdvrp("sample_instance.txt")
```

2. Find the MDVRP solution: 
```julia
gancp, nn_time, gancp_plus, total_time, mdvrp_routes = mdvrp_solve(instance)
````
Returns the top-five solution candidates obtained using GANCP, along with the predicted costs, GANCP time, GANCP<sup>+</sup> costs, and the total time. 
```julia
julia> print(gancp, "\n", nn_time, "\n", gancp_plus, "\n", total_time)

**Parameter Modifications**

1. Modify the device-specific memory limit and HGS-CVRP solver time in `src/parameters.jl`. 

2. Additional GA parameters can be provided as an input as follows:
````julia
include("src/parameters.jl")
hgs_time = find_HGS_time(instance)
gancp, nn_time, gancp_plus, total_time, mdvrp_routes = mdvrp_solve(instance;  weights=[1.0,0.4], pop_limit=[40,50], generations=3, hgs_time_limit=hgs_time, prob_repair=0.8)
````

3. The pre-trained weights of the neural network for the three training phases discussed in the paper are available in `cvrp-cost-prediction/weights`. Note that for more accurate cost predictions, the test data should follow the distribution of the training data.
